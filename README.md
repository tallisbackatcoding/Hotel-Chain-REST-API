# Hotel Chain System Management

## In this project, teams will implement a system to manage operations for an international hotel chain.  The system will need to keep track of guests, bookings, occupancy, seasonal changes, exceptional/emergency events and so on.  The system will allow role-based access for the roles of guest, desk clerk, and manager.  

•	As a user, I want to access a home page that provides general information about the hotel chain, provides links to services offered by hotel web application, and give users the ability to log in
•	As a guest, I want to query the system so that I can find available rooms (by date, destination, occupancy) and create a booking
•	As a guest, I want to create a profile so that I can manage my past and upcoming bookings
•	As a desk clerk, I want to cancel, create, and change, bookings so that I can fulfill guest requests
•	As a manager, I want to review the schedules of all hotel employees so that I can make payroll and adjust hours
•	As a manager, I want to create and cancel seasonal rates and issue advisories so that I can ensure that guests and employees have up-to-date information
